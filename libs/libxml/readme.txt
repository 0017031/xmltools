Compilation
-----------
The plugin compilation required libxml dependencies. Due to their size,
these dependencies are compressed in .7z archives available in x86 and
x64 subfolder.

In order to compile the project, you'll have to unzip the archives. In
both x86 and x64 subfolder, just right-clic on all archives and select
"extract here".

The VisualStudio project is already configured to search libs in these
"libxml/x86" and "libxml/x64" subfolders.

Librairies
----------
Libraries are stored in git repository for simplification purposes. They
car also be downloaded online on external sources.

For instance, they can be fetched here:
